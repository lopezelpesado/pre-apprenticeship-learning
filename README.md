# Pre-apprenticeship Learning

This repo is for my learnings and projects during the FAC22 pre-apprenticeship.

There will be folders for each week and I'll try and fill them with .mds with my notes for each thing I work through. Might link to other repos for projects.

I'll create a lil' site to click through to each week. Each week can be a separate page with links to my notes and projects.

# todo
