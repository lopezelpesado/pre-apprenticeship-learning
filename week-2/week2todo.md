# Week 2 (30/6/21 - 6/7/21)

Here's the [schedule for week 2]().

These are the things left over from last week:

- [ ] Learn about accessibility and building sites for everyone
- [ ] Sign up for JavaScript 30 and...
- [ ] ...complete the JavaScript Drum Kit project and...
- [ ] ...complete the CSS + JS Clock project
- [ ] Learn about markdown...
- [ ] ...and practice it
- [ ] Implement ES6 array methods a for loops
- [ ] Spend time with Jackson Gabbard

These are the things I need to do based on the schedule:

And here are some other things I want to do:

- [ ] Create a script that generates 11 combos of 4 groups of 3 people. Any 2 people share the same group exactly twice and no 3 people are in the same group more than once. No group should be majoritively male. *Might not be solvable.*
- [ ] Read the docs on writing kata and...
- [ ] ...make improvements to my kata

I also need to continue to be active on twitter and work on Execute Program's Modern JavaScript and Arrays sections every (working day) so this next section will keep track of that:
