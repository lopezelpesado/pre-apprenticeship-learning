# Terminal Learning

## [A Linux Command Line Primer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-linux-command-line-primer)

### Intro

- GUIs don't provide the greatest power over our machines
- GUIs aren't always as accessible as the could be
- CLI (command-line interface) can be used with your local or remote machine
- `$` at the end of prompt means you are logged in as a regular user
- `#` means elevated privileges (root user, considered super user or admin)
- `sudo` command gives you admin priviliges
- Be careful on local machine terminals as admin changes could be permanent
- A command is an instruction given by a user telling a computer what to do

### Directories

- `pwd` (present working directory), tells you where you are right now
- `home/sammy` is a user directory
- A root user would have the `/root` directory
- `mkdir` (make directory), creates directories
