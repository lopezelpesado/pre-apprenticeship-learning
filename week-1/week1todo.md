And here are some other things I want to do:

- [ ] Create a script that generates 11 combos of 4 groups of 3 people. Any 2 people share the same group exactly twice and no 3 people are in the same group more than once. No group should be majoritively male. *Might not be solvable.*

I also need to get active on twitter and work on Execute Program's Modern JavaScript and Arrays sections every (working day) so this next section will keep track of that:
